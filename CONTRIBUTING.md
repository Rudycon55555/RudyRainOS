# Contribiting
I'd _really_ like if people contributed to this open-source project--RudyRainOS! Though, you'd need to follow some RudyRainOS Guidelines:

  - Everything must be open-source under GPLv3.0
  - All changes (editing, adding, removing, etc.) must be safe and help RudyRainOS
  - Everything must follow our goals
  - It must have as much as possible in Zig
  - For changes, _please do not start a pull request_! Instead, follow these steps:
    1. Fork the repository and make the changes
    2. Review them with humans very carefully
    3. Review them with AIs very carefully
    4. Revise
    5. Repeat until ready
    6. Create ISOs for each CPU arch RudyRainOS is for
    7. Email me \<rudrafordev@protonmail.com> about the changes in detail _and_ the link to the repository
    8. I'll review
    9. If I think I like it, I'll release the ISOs
  - Create the ISOs--it's too much for me
    * Each ISO needs to be on top of on the last RudyRainOS version
    * The first one on top of Debian:Bookworm/Debian:12
