# My Goals For RudyRainOS
## Mains
I want RudyRainOS to be [one of the] _first_ operating systems to have components in Zig.
It is a build-apon of Debian, but seems like a whoe system.
# Works On
I want RudyRainOS to be _truely_ corss-platform--featuring [pretty much the same inside] versions for:

  - x86_64

  - aarch64

  - arm

  - powerpc64le

  - riscv64

  - s390x
