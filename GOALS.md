I want RudyRainOS to be [one of the] _first_ operating systems to have components in Zig.
It is a build-apon of Debian, but seems like a whoe system.
# Works On
I want RudyRainOS to be _truely_ corss-platform--featuring [pretty much the same inside] versions for:

  - x86_64-linux-gnu

  - aarch64-linux-gnu

  - arm-linux-gnueabihf

  - powerpc64le-linux-gnu

  - riscv64-linux-gnu

  - s390x-linux-gnu
